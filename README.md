# pyCFDtoolkit

A toolkit mainly to post-process CFD results. At the current development stage, it mainly provides tools to controll ANSYS-CFX simulations.


## Ansys CFX control
With the module `cfx` you can manipulate ANSYS-CFX cases and manage (start, stop, resume) your runs easily in an object-oriented way.
